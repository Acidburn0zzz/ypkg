.SH "NAME"
\fBpackage\.yml\fR \- Solus package build format
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.
.nf

The Solus package build format, with YAML syntax\.
.
.fi
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The primary format of package builds in Solus, \fBpackage\.yml(5)\fR provides a modern, declarative, and structured format in which to define metadata and steps, to convert a build operation into a package\.
.
.P
\fBypkg\-build(1)\fR will use the advanced patterns system and some very specific internal rules to automatically split the package into multiple packages, refered to here as "subpackages"\.
.
.SH "CONFIGURATION FORMAT"
\fBypkg\-build(1)\fR uses the YAML file format\. However, this is a very specialised flavour of YAML with very specific extensions and types\.
.
.P
\fBKeys\fR
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBname\fR [string]
.
.IP
Set the name of the package\. In general this should try to match the upstream source name wherever possible\. All subpackages generated by \fBypkg\-build(1)\fR will have this \fBname\fR as a prefix\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBversion\fR [string]
.
.IP
The version of the software being packaged\. This should match the upstream version, i\.e\. that of the tarball or git tag\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBrelease\fR [integer]
.
.IP
Packages within Solus are updated by their \fBrelease number\fR\. This number must start at 1 in new packages, and be incremented for every new update or change to the package that is published\.
.
.IP
It is perfectly acceptable to push an update with a \fBlower version\fR by bumping the release number\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBlicense\fR [string(s)]
.
.IP
One or more strings that identify the software license of this package\. This should in most cases be a recognised \fBSPDX\fR license name\.
