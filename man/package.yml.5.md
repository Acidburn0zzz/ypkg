package.yml(5) -- Solus package build format
==========================================
    
## SYNOPSIS

    The Solus package build format, with YAML syntax.

## DESCRIPTION

The primary format of package builds in Solus, `package.yml(5)` provides a modern,
declarative, and structured format in which to define metadata and steps, to
convert a build operation into a package.

`ypkg-build(1)` will use the advanced patterns system and some very specific
internal rules to automatically split the package into multiple packages,
refered to here as "subpackages".


## CONFIGURATION FORMAT

`ypkg-build(1)` uses the YAML file format. However, this is a very specialised flavour
of YAML with very specific extensions and types.

* `name`

    Set the name of the package. In general this should try to match the upstream
    source name wherever possible. All subpackages generated by `ypkg-build(1)` will
    have this `name` as a prefix.

    A string value is expected for this key.
