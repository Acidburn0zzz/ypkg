ypkg
-----

Post-packaging complement to eopkg of Evolve OS.

Simple YAML file format is used in place of the more complex actions.py
and pspec.xml traditionally used within Evolve OS.

Once the software builds succesfully (which might mean tweaking your
configure, or installing build dependencies..) it is then turned into
"proper" packages", or rather .eopkg's using Evolve OS's native mechanism.

Because life is too short.
