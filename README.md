ypkg
-----

Post-packaging complement to eopkg of Solus Operating System.

Simple YAML file format is used in place of the more complex actions.py
and pspec.xml traditionally used within Solus Operating System.

Once the software builds succesfully (which might mean tweaking your
configure, or installing build dependencies..) it is then turned into
"proper" packages", or rather .eopkg's using Solus's native mechanism.

Because life is too short.
